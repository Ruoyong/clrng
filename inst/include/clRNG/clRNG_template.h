/*
 * ! @file clRNG_template.h
 *  @brief Template of the specialized interface for specific generators (not to be included as is!)
 *
 *  The function and type names in this API all start with \c clrng.
 *  In each specific implementation, this prefix is expanded to a specific prefix;
 *  e.g., \c clrngMrg31k3p for the MRG31k3p generator.
 *  
 *  In the standard case, streams and substreams are defined as in \cite iLEC08j,
 *  \cite rLEC91a, \cite rLEC02a .
 *  The sequence of successive states of the base RNG over its entire period of length \f$\rho\f$ 
 *  is divided into streams whose starting points are \f$Z\f$ steps apart.
 *  The sequence for each stream (of length \f$Z\f$) is further divided into substreams of length \f$W\f$. 
 *  The integers \f$Z\f$ and \f$W\f$ have default values that have been carefully selected 
 *  to avoid detectable dependence between successive streams and substreams, 
 *  and are large enough to make sure that streams and substreams will not be exhausted in practice.
 *  It is strongly recommended to never change these values (even if the software allows it).
 *  The initial state of the first stream (the seed of the library) has a default value.
 *  It can be changed by invoking clrngSetBaseCreatorState() before creating a first stream.
 *  
 *  A stream object is a structure that contains the current state of the stream, 
 *  its initial state (at the beginning of the stream),
 *  and the initial state of the current substream.
 *  Whenever the user creates a new stream, the software automatically jumps ahead by \f$Z\f$ steps 
 *  to find its initial state, and the three states in the stream object are set to it.
 *  The form of the state depends on the type of RNG.
 *  
 *  Some functions are available on both the host and the devices 
 *  (they can be used  within a kernel) whereas others (such as stream creation) 
 *  are available only on the host.
 *  Many functions are defined only for arrays of streams; 
 *  for a single stream, it suffices to specify an array of size 1.
 *  
 *  When a kernel is called, one should pass a copy of the streams from the host 
 *  to the global memory of the device.
 *  Another copy of the stream state must be stored in the private memory of the work item 
 *  that uses it in the kernel code to generate random numbers. 
 *  In the current implementation, to avoid wasting (scarce) private memory,
 *  without the option \c CLRNG_ENABLE_SUBSTREAMS (see below),
 *  only the current state of the stream is stored explicitly in the work-item's private memory.
 *  The work item also keeps in private memory a pointer to the initial state 
 *  of the stream, but this initial state is not copied into private memory,
 *  and the work item does not keep track of the initial state of the current substream.
 *  With the option  \c CLRNG_ENABLE_SUBSTREAMS,
 *  the initial state of the current substream is also stored into private memory.
 *  This permits one to rewind the current state to it or move forward to the next substream.
 *  
 *  To use the clRNG library from within a user-defined kernel, the
 *  user must include the clRNG header file corresponding to the desired RNG
 *  via an \c include directive.
 *  Other specific preprocessor macros can be placed *before*
 *  including the header file
 *  to change settings of the library when the default values are not suitable for the user.
 *  The following options are currently available:
 *
 *  - \c CLRNG_SINGLE_PRECISION:
 *    With this option, all the random numbers returned by clrngRandomU01() and
 *    clrngRandomU01Array(), and generated by clrngDeviceRandomU01Array(), will be of type
 *    \c cl_float instead of \c cl_double (the default setting).
 *    This option can be activated on the device and the host separately (i.e., on
 *    either one or on both), and affects all implemented RNGs.
 *  - \c CLRNG_ENABLE_SUBSTREAMS:
 *    With this option, the current state of a stream can be reset on the device to the initial state of the
 *    current or next substream. This is made possible by storing in private memory
 *    the initial substream state.
 *    Without this option, by default, this is not possible and only the current
 *    state of the stream and a pointer to its initial state (left in global memory)
 *    are kept in private memory and is accessible, in a work item.
 *    **This option applies only to the device; operations on substreams are 
 *    always available on the host.**
 *
 *  For example, to enable substreams support, generate single-precision floating point numbers 
 *  on the device, and use the MRG31k3p generator, one would have, in the device
 *  code:
 *  \code{c}
 *      #define  CLRNG_ENABLE_SUBSTREAMS
 *      #define  CLRNG_SINGLE_PRECISION
 *      #include <clRNG/mrg31k3p.clh>
 *  \endcode
 *
 *  To generate single-precision floating point numbers also on the host, still
 *  using the MRG31k3p generator, the host code should contain:
 *  \code{c}
 *      #define CLRNG_SINGLE_PRECISION
 *      #include <clRNG/mrg31k3p.h>
 *  \endcode
 *  
 *  The functions described here are all available on the host, in all implementations, 
 *  unless specified otherwise.  Only some of the functions and types are also
 *  available on the device in addition to the host;  they are tagged with
 *  [**device**].
 *  Other functions are only available on the device; they are tagged with
 *  [**device-only**].
 *  Some functions return an error code in \c err.

 *
 *
 *  ## The MRG31k3p Generator
 *
 *  The MRG31k3p generator is defined in \cite rLEC00b .
 *  In its specific implementation, the function and type names start with \c clrngMrg31k3p.
 *  For this RNG, a *state* is a vector of six 31-bit integers, 
 *  represented internally as \c cl_uint.
 *  The entire period length of approximately \f$2^{185}\f$ is divided into 
 *  approximately \f$2^{51}\f$ non-overlapping streams of length \f$Z=2^{134}\f$.
 *  Each stream is further partitioned into substreams of length \f$W=2^{72}\f$.
 *  The state (and seed) of each stream is a vector of six 31-bit integers.
 *  This size of state is appropriate for having streams running in work items on GPU cards,
 *  for example, while providing a sufficient period length for most applications. 
 *
 *
 *  ## The MRG32k3a Generator
 *
 *  MRG32k3a is a combined multiple recursive generator (MRG) proposed by L'Ecuyer \cite rLEC99b ,
 *  implemented here in 64-bit integer arithmetic.
 *  This RNG has a period length of approximately \f$2^{191}\f$,
 *  and is divided into approximately \f$2^{64}\f$ non-overlapping streams of length \f$Z = 2^{127}\f$,
 *  and each stream is subdivided in \f$2^{51}\f$ substreams of length \f$W = 2^{76}\f$.
 *  These are the same numbers as in \cite rLEC02a .
 *  The state of a stream at any given step is a six-dimensional vector of 32-bit integers, 
 *  but those integers are stored as \c cl_ulong (64-bit integers) in the present implementation 
 *  (so they use twice the space).
 *  The generator has 32 bits of resolution.
 *  Note that in the original version proposed in \cite rLEC99b and \cite rLEC02a, 
 *  the recurrences are implemented in \c double instead,
 *  and the state is stored in six 32-bit integers.
 *  The change in implementation is to avoid using \c double's,
 *  which are not available on many GPU devices, and also because the 64-bit implementation
 *  is much faster than that in \c double when 64-bit integer arithmetic is available on the hardware.
 *
 *
 *  ## The LFSR113 Generator
 *
 *  The LFSR113 generator is defined in \cite rLEC99a .
 *  In its implementation, the function and type names start with \c clrngLfsr113.
 *  For this RNG, a *state* vector of four 31-bit integers, 
 *  represented internally as \c cl_uint.
 *  The period length of approximately \f$2^{113}\f$ is divided into 
 *  approximately \f$2^{23}\f$ non-overlapping streams of length \f$Z=2^{90}\f$.
 *  Each stream is further partitioned into \f$2^{35}\f$ substreams of length \f$W=2^{55}\f$.
 *  Note that the functions \c clrngLfsr113ChangeStreamsSpacing() and 
 *  \c clrngLfsr113AdvancedStreams() are not implemented in the current version.
 *
 *
 *  ## The Philox-4Ã—32-10 Generator
 *
 *  The counter-based Philox-4Ã—32-10 generator is defined in \cite rSAL11a .
 *  Unlike the previous three generators, its design is not supported by a 
 *  theoretical analysis of equidistribution.
 *  It has only been subjected to empirical testing with the TestU01 software 
 *  \cite rLEC07b (the other three generators also have).
 *  In its implementation, the function and type
 *  names start with \c clrngPhilox432.
 *  For this RNG, a *state* is a 128-bit counter with a 64-bit key, 
 *  and a 2-bit index used to iterate over the four 32-bit outputs generated for 
 *  each counter value.
 *  The counter is represented internally as a vector of four 32-bit \c cl_uint
 *  values and the index, as a single \c cl_uint value.
 *  In the current clRNG version, the key is the same for all streams, so it 
 *  is not stored in each stream object but rather hardcoded in the implementation.
 *  The period length of \f$2^{130}\f$ is divided into \f$2^{28}\f$ non-overlapping streams 
 *  of length \f$Z=2^{102}\f$.
 *  Each stream is further partitioned into \f$2^{36}\f$ substreams of length \f$W=2^{66}\f$.
 *  The key (all bits to 0), initial counter and order in which the four outputs 
 *  per counter value are returned are chosen to generate the same values, in the 
 *  same order, as Random123's \c Engine module \cite rSAL11a, designed for 
 *  use with the standard C++11 \c random library.
 *  Note that the function \c clrngPhilox432ChangeStreamsSpacing() supports 
 *  only values of \f$c\f$ that are multiples of 4, with either \f$e = 0\f$ or \f$e 
 *  \geq 2\f$.

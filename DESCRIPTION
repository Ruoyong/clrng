Title: Parallel Random Number Generation on GPU
Description: Builds on 'gpuR' and utilizes the 'clRNG' ('OpenCL') library to provide efficient tools to generate independent random numbers in parallel on a GPU and save the results as 'R' objects, ensuring high-quality random numbers even when 'R' is used interactively or in an ad-hoc manner. Includes methods from Algorithm AS 159 Applied Statistics (1981), vol. 30, no. 1 <https://doi.org/10.2307/2346721> and clRNG library by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (2015) <https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clRNG>.

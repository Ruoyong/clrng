Description: The package builds on gpuR and utilizes the clRNG (OpenCL) library to provide efficient tools to generate independent random numbers in parallel on a GPU and save the results as R objects, and ensuring high-quality random numbers even when R is used interactively or in an ad-hoc manner.
